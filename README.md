# Image-Classification-Potato-Diseased-Plants
# Problem Statement
Farmers who grow potatoes suffer from serious financial standpoint losses each year which cause several diseases that affect potato plants. The diseases Early Blight and Late Blight are the most frequent. Early blight is caused by fungus and late blight is caused by specific micro-organisms and if farmers detect this disease early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save a lot of waste and prevent economical loss. The treatments for early blight and late blight are a little different so it’s important that you accurately identify what kind of disease is there in that potato plant.
# The Model
 Behind the scene, we are going to use Convolutional Neural Network – Deep Learning to diagnose plant diseases. In the data pre-processing stage we used the tf.data to import images in batches in order to save the computation power. The use of cache and prefetch function from the tensorflow library hels to keep the image in the memory of the device in order to improve the pipeline performance. In order to handle new images from the web, the model uses the Rescale and Resize function. To be more forgiving of changes in the object’s orientation, position, and size in the image we have used Data Augmentation. In the output we get the type of the batch and the confidence level to ensure that our prediction is upto the mark.
